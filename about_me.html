      So, a little about me.  I was born and raised on a small achorage outside of Omaha in Arlington.  After high school, I joined the Marine Corps and traveled the world.  It wasn't until I got back from my deployment that I decided I better finish school.

      I attended the University of Pheonix where I attained a Bachelor's of Sceince in Management.  I decided to go back to attain another degree in Management of Information Systems.  From there, I am trying to enter the dual masters program for MBA/MIS.
